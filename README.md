This work is a simple implementation with object-oriented programming.

I coded part of the process of adding a company's employee information and saving it to a file.

I used separate OOPs to add employee information and save it in the generated excel file.
##########

when the program is run

*All records are saved in an excel file created by the program.

-add employee

-retrieve the information of the desired employee

-fetch the entire employee list

-salary increase

-employee deregistration

All operations such as this can be done.
